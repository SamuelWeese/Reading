## Explanation

Really I should be writing a database with a nice front end for this... probably will do on another vacation. This will suffice for the 15 minutes I put into it.

## To Read

Below is a series of books I have marked to read. I initially thought to put who recommended them to me, and then I realized I might be "outing" too much. I instead am using a series of code names for my own sake, which render to correct names in my viewer. I'm sure I have more recommendations, I am tired though and going to sleep.
